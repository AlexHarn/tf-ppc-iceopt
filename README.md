# TensorFlow Ice Model Optimization
This project aims to demonstrate how to fit Icecube ice model parameters (for now only absorption coefficients) using TensorFlow for gradient descent. This is done in the same way demonstrated by my toy ice model optimization repository, here we use PPC for the photon propagation instead.
